  description: "You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.\n\nFind two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n\nReturn the maximum amount of water a container can store.",
