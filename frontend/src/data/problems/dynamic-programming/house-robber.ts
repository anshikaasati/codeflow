  description: "You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.\n\nGiven an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.",
  examples: [
  {
    "input": "nums = [1,2,3,1]",
    "output": "4",
    "explanation": "Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4."
  },
  {
    "input": "nums = [2,7,9,3,1]",
    "output": "12",
    "explanation": "Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1). Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12."
