  description: "You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.\\n\\nThe rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.\\n\\nYou start at the top left square `(0, 0)`. What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square `(n - 1, n - 1)`?",

    "explanation": "At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0). You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0. You cannot reach index (1, 1) until time 3, when the maximum of elevations along the path is 3."
