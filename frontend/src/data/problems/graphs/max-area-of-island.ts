  description: "You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of '1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n\nThe area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.\n\nReturn the maximum area of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return 0.",
